[Verse 1]
Ceilings, plaster
Can't you just make it move faster?
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short
<br>
[Chorus]
Then you're driving me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before
<br>
[Verse 2]
Bed sheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos
<br>
[Chorus]
But it's over
Then you're driving me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
<br>
[Outro]
But it's not real
And you don't exist
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed
It hits me in the car
And it feels like the end of a movie I've seen before
Before
